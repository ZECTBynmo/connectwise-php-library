#  ConnectWise PHP Library

This library was generated by the [ConnectWise PHP Generator](https://git.spinen.net/libraries/connectwise-php-generator). 

This repository is a READ-ONLY subtree spit of the Generator package, so all of the test are in that project.  All of the work is done in that repository to allow testing the client &amp; library in the same project.  Please direct any issues/PR's to that project.

When using the generated Signature Trait, you need to implement the Signature interface (Spinen\ConnectWise\Library\Contracts) to make sure that you have all of the expected methods.
